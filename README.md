# What are GNN ?
GNNs can be used to answer questions about multiple characteristics of these graphs. By working at the graph level, we try to predict characteristics of the entire graph. We can identify the presence of certain “shapes,” like circles in a graph that might represent sub-molecules or perhaps close social relationships. 

GNNs can be used on node-level tasks, to classify the nodes of a graph, and predict partitions and affinity in a graph similar to image classification or segmentation. Finally, we can use GNNs at the edge level to discover connections between entities, perhaps using GNNs to “prune” edges to identify the state of objects in a scene.
